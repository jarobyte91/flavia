meets online with the faculty member through streaming audio and video at a predetermined time.\",\"48\":\"A major disadvantage of synchronous e-learning is the issue of having to meet at specific time, hence, time flexibility is lost.\",\"49\":\"With asynchronous learning, a student can participate in the learning activities at the most suitable time for him or her but this also means that the faculty member will not be available for immediate replies.\",\"50\":\"A set of tools called Learning Management Systems (LMS) is typically utilized with e-learning and there are many types of LMS.\",\"51\":\"Some of LMS are commercial products and the most popular one is called Blackboard (http:\\/\\/www.blackboard.com) and others are open-source such as Moodle

learning, encourage students to be more interested in learning, be a good teaching tool because of gender segregation in the Saudi higher-education system and create a challenge for faculty.\",\"63\":\"He also mentioned the main nine barriers for WBI and e-leaning in KSA which are lack of knowledge, lack of enough time to develop WBI, lack of clear WBI policies, lack of clear course ownership policies, lack of peer support, lack of technical support, lack of monetary incentive, lack of administrative support and lack of governmental support.\",\"64\":\"Finally, he suggested several recommendations such as developing further studies to determine if there are other factors affecting the implementation of WBI at Saudi universities beyond his findings.\",\"65\":\"Mirza [58] stated that e-learning is a great option for many Saudi students who are interested in higher education from reputable international universities and who cannot travel to other countries due to family, financial and or employment obligations.\",\"66\":\"However, old regulations at the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) have managed to find their way into the 21st century.\",\"67\":\"The author gave an example for MOHE regulations, in order to approve a degree from any international university a student must present evidence that his\\/her time was dedicated to studying on a full-time basis while residing in the country where the degree was earned, (http:\\/\\/www2.mohe.gov.sa\\/accreditation\\/Acc_Requirements.aspx).\",\"68\":\"Mirza mentioned that elearning in the developed world has become a great success because it provides students with the convenience and flexibility of studying at their own pace, time and cost.\",\"69\":\"However, it is not free of drawbacks; he mentioned some drawbacks of e-learning such as high initial costs to setup, the on-going costs for maintenance, the fact that not all students are self-motivators, hence, they may easily fall behind and the inability to properly assess the performance of students who use the system.\",\"70\":\"Mirza also stated that in 2007 Saudi Arabian-MOHE has established a National Center for e-Learning and Distance Learning (NCeDL) which aims to support in the creation of electronic educational material, and providing an electronic venue for faculty members of any local university to utilize in creating e-courses through its own LMS called JUSUR (http:\\/\\/www.elc.edu.sa\\/portal).\",\"71\":\"He mentioned several public and private schools start to adopt e-learning system and a good number of Saudi schools and colleges have already moving towards the application of e-learning.\",\"72\":\"Finally, he recommended establishing a set of new policies that allow students to take virtual online degrees.\",\"73\":\"Kamla [59] defined the Learning Management Systems (LMS) as an online system that allows users to share information and collaborate online and she

particularly, LMS could be utilized by educational institutions as well as corporate ones with a major focus on managing the education process rather than merely delivering course and training materials electronically.\",\"75\":\"The author stated that the main propose of her research is to find the relevant external variables that influence the instructors' acceptance of LMS.\",\"76\":\"Kamla stated that the main critical factors that might influence the instructors' perceived ease of use and usefulness of LMS can be categorized by instructor, organization and technology factors.\",\"77\":\"Instructor factors include self efficacy, attitude toward LMS, experience, teaching style and personal innovativeness, while organization factors include motivators,

Students' usability survey revealed was that JUSUR LMS is easy to use and learn for students with advanced computer competency and the most significant problems were the malfunction of the search feature and the difficulty of downloading course materials.\",\"86\":\"She believed that further usability studies needed to evaluate JUSUR using different variables such as users' computer competency, gender and major.\",\"87\":\"Hisham [61] stated that the selection procedure for LMS start by selecting and identifying user needs, choosing a range of products required by the user and verifying requirements, assessing the advantages and disadvantages of LMS, sorting products in terms of advantages and disadvantages, then determining the results and choosing the alternative best suited to the needs of the user.\",\"88\":\"The author stated that about 1283 course out of 2336 courses offered in the first semester of the academic year 2009\\/2010 by JUSUR.\",\"89\":\"He lunched two important questions in his research: what trends faculty members in Saudi universities to use LMS bridges and what are the obstacles to use system bridges from the viewpoint of faculty members in Saudi universities?\",\"90\":\"The author concludes that there are positive trends from the members of the faculty towards the use of e-learning bridges.\",\"91\":\"He also stated that the physical barriers from using JUSURE are college infrastructure, lack of the availability of computer equipments or internet service and the absence of direct technical support to faculty members and students before and during the use of the system.\",\"92\":\"The personal barriers mentioned by the user are the fear of technology, community resistance to the operations of e-learning as a luxury and fun, lack of awareness of the foundations of the system, weak awareness of the importance of some department heads and the refusal to activate e-learning and finally some faculty members consider e-learning system is just win but there are other administrative obstacles such as lack of support from the Scientific Section.\",\"93\":\"The author suggested activating the management systems of

include: 1) Security threats: A major obstacle to cloud computing is the security threats including tampering or leakage of sensitive data on the cloud, loss of privacy and the unauthorized use of the data by cloud providers [62-67].\",\"259\":\"Hence, a number of security requirements should be satisfied by educational cloud computing systems to protect data from these threats [55,56].\",\"260\":\"These requirements are [68]: \\u0002 Identification and Authentication: cloud service providers should establish accounts for faculty, students, and staff who should be individually verified and validated by employing usernames and passwords to protect their profiles on the cloud.\",\"261\":\"\\u0002 Authorization: priorities, permissions and resource ownerships on the cloud should be controlled.\",\"262\":\"Each individual of faculty, staff, or students in the institution is granted privileges based on his account.\",\"263\":\"\\u0002 Integrity and Confidentiality: encryption techniques should be employed to protect sensitive data of institution such as exams, grades, etc from tampering or unauthorized access.\",\"264\":\"\\u0002 Non-repudiation: ensure that institution\\u2019s transaction send and receive transfer cannot be denied.\",\"265\":\"Techniques such as digital signatures, timestamps and confirmation receipt services

their work better and faster than ever.\",\"287\":\"The MOEH in KSA sent a lot of students to complete their PhD in e-learning and cloud computing in development countries such as UK, USA and

recommendations in e-learning platforms which is composed of two modules: an off-line module which pre-processes data to build learner and content models and an online module which uses these models

to come from outside and we consider cloud computing education system is promised in KSA because there are financial supports, government commitment and subtle pressure from women faculty for change.\",\"293\":\"The study presented in this paper helps the leadership and decision makers improve education and provides advises to educational institutions and individuals on the tremendous

abundance of useful information available on any subject, anywhere, anytime, and on any device, the challenge (faced by all us, the educators) is to create a teaching\\/learning environment that is mobile, smart, personable, and easy to use.\",\"626\":\"Next generation's learning tools will require that we receive only the information we need at the right time.\",\"627\":\"Future applications will also require natural interfaces that allow students (as well as instructors) to interact with any computing device with ease.\",\"628\":\"The time for having \\u201cproblem solving

[1].\",\"630\":\"Such environments, in general, should enable the user to input and work on problems in a manner that is natural to the problem domain.\",\"631\":\"The animation data structures and algorithms integrated with a natural pen-based interface is one of the most valuable environments in the classroom setting.\",\"632\":\"Intuitively we, the computer science educators, believe that algorithm animation is helpful in teaching advanced computer science concepts.\",\"633\":\"Students often study in either of the following two distinct modes according to their cognitive learning style.\",\"634\":\"The first study mode is the initial learning of an algorithm and the associated data structure.\",\"635\":\"In this mode students simply step through an algorithm to attain a preliminary grasp of the algorithm.\",\"636\":\"This process of learning can be supported either by textual algorithm description or graphical algorithm animation.\",\"637\":\"Some studies [2] have shown little improvement in student performance (mostly on analytical questions) due to the use of animations in teaching data structures and algorithms.\",\"638\":\"Another study [3] has shown that

in the classroom by students and their instructors.\",\"644\":\"The reason is that most of the evaluations indicate that algorithm animation has no significant effect when students are just

Tablet PC environment will have a fundamental influence on education in general.\",\"647\":\"One of the principal aims of our study is to investigate the suitability of a Tablet PC environment in

thinking.\",\"651\":\"2.\",\"652\":\"SOLUTION EMPLOYED Creating new interfaces is not a simple task; it has already been the subject of years of intensive research.\",\"653\":\"Our work will be built upon research projects currently underway at MIT (see [4]) and CMU (see [5]).\",\"654\":\"The primary goal of these projects is to develop a library of domainbased gesture recognition tools.\",\"655\":\"Therefore, our project is not concerned with developing recognition tools but rather utilizing what is currently available.\",\"656\":\"Our contribution to, and aim for, this is to automatically associate a geometrical drawing with the underlying data structure model.\",\"657\":\"We restrict ourselves to simple geometrical drawings, such as a circle, a straight line, and a polygon.\",\"658\":\"However, even in this trivial setting there is a lot of heuristics and uncertainties.\",\"659\":\"As an example, consider the hierarchy of the following data structures: a graph, a tree, a binary tree, a search binary tree.\",\"660\":\"Drawing each of these data structures requires only two graphical primitives: a circle and a line, so recognition does not represent a problem.\",\"661\":\"Correct understanding and interpretation of the drawing is a whole different story.\",\"662\":\"Domain-based interpretation is the cornerstone of our system.\",\"663\":\"We restrict ourselves to the following three most important topics in CS2: self-adjusted Binary Search Trees, Minimum Spanning Trees and Single Source Shortest Paths.\",\"664\":\"Each of these topics includes one or more specific domains.\",\"665\":\"The development of the interface can be broken down into four key parts: 1) stroke recognition and beautification, 2) the association of strokes to an underlying domain-dependent data structure, 3) the animation of algorithms, and 4) the verification of algorithms.\",\"666\":\"The stroke recognition aspect comes into play when the user takes the stylus and draws a stroke on the Tablet PC.\",\"667\":\"A series of points are digitized and then analyzed for feature points.\",\"668\":\"The latter play a dominant role in shape perception by humans.\",\"669\":\"If these characteristic points are identified properly, a shape can be represented in an efficient and compact way with accuracy sufficient for a given application.\",\"670\":\"Various complicated corner detection algorithms have been developed (see [6].)\",\"671\":\"Since drawings in our environment do not require high accuracy one can choose any of those algorithms.\",\"672\":\"Once feature points have been detected, the next step is to classify the stroke and therefore to recognize the shape.\",\"673\":\"For example, triangles can be detected by three feature points and the closed line segments between them.\",\"674\":\"Furthermore, an important part of this recognition is the beautification of these strokes.\",\"675\":\"In the example of binary search trees, when a student intends to draw a straight line, the system should snap the stroke to a straight line, beautifying the drawing.\",\"676\":\"The same can be said of nodes; since most people cannot draw perfect circles, the system should snap elliptical strokes into perfect circles upon recognition with the condition that all nodes look the same (have the same radius).\",\"677\":\"The next segment of this tool is the on-the-fly association of strokes with elements of the data structure.\",\"678\":\"In the example of BSTs, each ellipse drawn will correspond to an existing node in the data structure and each edge between two nodes will represent a reference from the parent node to the child node.\",\"679\":\"Consequently, each domain may require a set of heuristics in order to provide a simple, user-friendly interface.\",\"680\":\"In the example of BSTs, with every pair of nodes that is connected by an edge, the node whose height on the screen is greater than the other will be designated the parent and the other node the child.\",\"681\":\"The important part of this segment is that every edit to the canvas will result in an on-the-fly edit to the underlying data structure.\",\"682\":\"It is important to mention here the equilibrium between a non-restrictive intuitive interface and theoretical correctness of the associated data structuremeaning that rules of the domain must not be violated.\",\"683\":\"In the example of BSTs, no node may have more than two children, each node can have at most one parent, there are to be no cycles in any tree, and if there is data in the tree, the ordering property will be verified\\u2026etc.\",\"684\":\"The last two major segments of this tool are the animation and verification of the algorithms as performed on hand-drawn data structures.\",\"685\":\"The system will give U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright 2011 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)

graphically (manually) perform an algorithm execution having the system verify the correctness of each step performed.\",\"688\":\"These two segments are of great pedagogical importance.\",\"689\":\"This system does not dependent on any terse language, cultural differences, nor \\u201chand-wavy\\u201d explanations and arguments.\",\"690\":\"Imagine the ideal situation when a PowerPoint lecture presentation seamlessly incorporates the algorithm animation tool.\",\"691\":\"Such highly interactive multimedia environment can assist in demonstrating and exploring the algorithm concepts from various perspectives.\",\"692\":\"Moreover, if every student had a Tablet PC, they can go home and practice on their own, the very same day, the things that were taught in lecture.\",\"693\":\"3.\",\"694\":\"EVALUATION PLANS A preliminary version of this new learning tool has been initially tested in 15-121 and 15-211 courses taught at Carnegie Mellon University in the summer of 2009.\",\"695\":\"It is planned that systematic assessment of the learning outcomes will be conducted with the help of the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence at CMU (see [7]).\",\"696\":\"The Eberly Center is currently collecting data from a pilot group of students who are using Tablet PC\\u2019s in an introductory computer science programming course.\",\"697\":\"We will be using some of that technique to measure the usability aspect of the tablet PC and its effectiveness in improving student performance.\",\"698\":\"We are hopeful to develop specific techniques to follow up with two groups of students.\",\"699\":\"One group would take a traditional data structure course; the second group would be given Tablet PCs with the algorithm animation tool.\",\"700\":\"The subject areas included in the evaluation would be binary search trees, AVL trees, splay trees and the minimum spanning trees.\",\"701\":\"The visualization tool is intended to be used during a four week period.\",\"702\":\"In addition, we plan to evaluate this tool according to students\\u2019 cognitive learning styles based on the FelderSilverman style model [8, 9].\",\"703\":\"This model classifies students as: (1) sensitive or intuitive learners, (2) visual or verbal learners, (3) active or reflective learners, and (4) sequential or global learners.\",\"704\":\"Depending on a particular style of learning, some students may (or may not) benefit from algorithm animation.\",\"705\":\"It would be interesting to determine how algorithm animation on Tablet PCs influences different groups of students.\",\"706\":\"4.\",\"707\":\"FUTURE PLANS: PEN-BASED PROOFS Experience shows that many Computer Science students have great difficulties with the proofs methods encountered in, say, an advanced course on algorithms.\",\"708\":\"Indeed, often the logical foundation of a proof argument seems to escape some of the students.\",\"709\":\"We propose to transform students\\u2019 experience with proofs by incorporating pen-based technology into introductory computer science courses.\",\"710\":\"In particular, we consider formal proofs in Euclidean geometry.\",\"711\":\"The cornerstone of this model is the concept of geometrical sketching dynamically combined with an underlying mathematical model.\",\"712\":\"A completely natural way of drawing using a digital pen will generate a system of polynomial equations of several variables.\",\"713\":\"The latter will be fed to a theorem prover (see [10, 11]), based on the Gr\\u0151bner bases technique, that will automatically establish inner properties of the model.\",\"714\":\"Moreover, once a particular mathematical model is created and then checked for accuracy, it will serve as a basis for logical deduction of various geometrical statements that might follow.\",\"715\":\"Lastly, a detailed step-by-step exposition of the proving process will be provided.\",\"716\":\"While theorem provers have become surprisingly powerful over the last decade, they are still too cumbersome to use and too limited in their capabilities to have any impact as teaching tools.\",\"717\":\"As a case in point, see the recent study by Freek Wiedijk [12] where the fifteen major systems available today are challenged to prove that the square-root of 2 is irrational.\",\"718\":\"One way around this problem is to use a hybrid system that combines a pure theorem prover with a computer algebra system, like Mathematica and Maple.\",\"719\":\"In such hybrid systems the theorem prover organizes and controls the logical part of the argument whereas the computer algebra system takes care of all algebraic manipulations.\",\"720\":\"Application of this rule shortens some proofs tremendously, and also brings the argument much closer to the form that a human prover would employ.\",\"721\":\"For our purposes such a simple pragmatic solution will suffice.\",\"722\":\"To avoid interface issues we chose Analytica, a system that is implemented entirely within the computer algebra system Mathematica, see [13].\",\"723\":\"Sophisticated algorithms such as Gr\\u0151bner bases and cylindrical algebra decomposition are readily available in this environment.\",\"724\":\"Analytica is currently used (see [14]) as an auxiliary tool in a discrete mathematics course at CMU to motivate the strict
