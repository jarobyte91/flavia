VEHICULAR AD HOC NETWORKING The VANET is a localized network that driver-less cars use to communicate with other driver-less cars within their vicinity.\",\"566\":\"The VANET is used to exchange

control itself.\",\"575\":\"By jamming the communication channels of the VANET, the vehicle cannot receive information from other driver-less cars on the road, and therefore would make the vehicle
