earlier publications [3,4] without being explicit.\",\"1\":\"It would seem that the principle of modularity [5] that Wilson mentions when discussing how flocks of starlings forage, also applies to his own writing, making it interesting to observe how the same phrases evolve over the various publications.\",\"2\":\"Perhaps one day, a historian of science will track this and describe them in more detail.\",\"3\":\"Wilson likely had interested laymen in mind when drafting this monograph; specialists will not find new material, as the greater part of the book has been published repeatedly over the past 14 years.\",\"4\":\"Wilson tries to take small steps, allowing nonscientists to follow his reasoning and even explains the basics of evolution.\",\"5\":\"As is often the case in popular science books, instead of endnotes, references are only presented in the bibliography, grouped by chapter, making it difficult to find the source of a statement or additional information on a specific topic.\",\"6\":\"This is alas further hampered by some references being listed in the wrong chapter.\",\"7\":\"In the first half of the booklet, Wilson discusses the major transitions in evolution and how eusociality is an evolutionary relatively young and rare invention, despite the success it bestowed to social insects (especially termites and ants, to a lesser degree to social bees and wasps).\",\"8\":\"He continues laying out a scenario for the evolution of helping behaviour based on offspring staying and helping at the nest, rather than dispersing.\",\"9\":\"The definition of eusociality used here is broad: \\u2018eusocial species are those practising altruism\\u2019, thereby encompassing also humans.\",\"10\":\"Certainly, this definition underlines commonalities between different cooperative breeders, but at the expense of losing meaningful categories [6].\",\"11\":\"Throughout his book, Wilson stresses the importance of higher levels of selection and a quarter of the book is dedicated, explicitly, to promote group selection.\",\"12\":\"While group selection is hailed, kin selection is dismissed, and a large number of fine biologists are defamed as \\u2018a small school of dedicated \\u2018\\u2018IF theorists\\u2019\\u2019\\u2019.\",\"13\":\"This is unlikely to calm down the controversy; maybe attempts to reconcile the two camps will be more constructive [7].\",\"14\":\"In any case, the examples brought forward are not convincing and are also readily explained by kin selection.\",\"15\":\"When it comes to verbal models, kin selection theory cannot easily be refuted, and a good understanding of mathematics is required to appreciate the challenges of inclusive fitness theory.\",\"16\":\"The final 15 pages are devoted to the evolution of humans.\",\"17\":\"The general scenario provided is not new: making use of fire may have allowed a higher calorie intake, facilitating the evolution of larger brains.\",\"18\":\"However, recent

Sousa-Lima et al., 2013; Gibb et al., 2019), (2) storage and battery capacity support longer autonomous deployments, (3) advances in signal processing related to machine learning and artificial intelligence make harvesting valuable information from the large volume of soundscape data tractable (Caruso et al., 2020; Shiu et al., 2020), and (4) national\\/international policy and regulation recognize ocean sound as an ocean parameter to be managed due to the potential negative impacts on the marine environment (Tasker et al., 2010; Duarte et al., 2021).\",\"672\":\"Innovative ocean sound applications associated with policy and economy now include soundscapes being used as a functional management tool (Van Parijs et al., 2009) and as an indicator of global economy and trade (Frisk, 2012; Thomson and Barclay, 2020).\",\"673\":\"Ocean sound is now an essential ocean variable (EOV) of the Biology and Ecosystem component of Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) (Ocean Sound EOV, 2018) creating the opportunity to make the recording of soundscapes routine within the structured framework of the GOOS data acquisition and public access plan.\",\"674\":\"In addition to the incorporation of passive acoustic sensors into formal ocean observation and monitoring systems like GOOS and the International Monitoring System (IMS) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), there are hundreds of hydrophone systems deployed throughout the world\\u2019s oceans by independent organizations and individuals (Haralabus et al., 2017; Tyack et al., 2021).\",\"675\":\"The International Quiet Ocean Experiment (IQOE) Program has recognized the unique opportunity to coordinate the analysis of local and regional ocean soundscape projects and recordings in an effort to gain a better understanding of global patterns and trends and how observed changes might impact marine life (Boyd et al., 2011; Tyack et al., 2021).\",\"676\":\"To make the IQOE vision a reality and to enable accurate comparison of ocean sound levels and soundscape characteristics among different projects and regions over time, standard guidelines for data processing and reporting are necessary.\",\"677\":\"A critical first step toward standardizing the ocean soundscape community occurred in 2017 when the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed ISO Standard 18405 on Underwater Acoustics-Terminology to facilitate a common language and definitions of soundscape measurements and products across projects (International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 2017).\",\"678\":\"Individual programs are advancing the effort to communicate and share specific project guidelines for processing and reporting soundscape metrics to enable direct comparisons between project results [e.g., Atlantic Deepwater Ecosystem Observatory Network (ADEON) \\u2013 Ainslie et al., 2018; Programme for Ambient Noise North Sea (JOMOPANS) \\u2013 Merchant et al., 2018].\",\"679\":\"Likewise, multiple national and international entities have recognized the need for standardizing soundscape analysis and reporting which has led to the convening of cross-sector workshops of ocean stakeholders to develop protocols and guidelines for producing and using soundscape data to identify salient patterns and trends in ocean sound levels (Martin et al., 2021).\",\"680\":\"Ocean sound measurements and modeling workshops convened over the past 7 years (Table 1) took the second step of recommending consensus methods for the analysis of underwater acoustic data and reporting of ocean sound levels to ensure accurate comparisons between studies utilizing different recording hardware, measurement protocols, and signal processing methods.\",\"681\":\"The 2018 Consortium for Ocean Leadership (COL) Ocean Sound Workshop strongly recommended the development of a standardized, publicly available, user-friendly software package that would create data products consistent with the consensus specifications identified for the processing and reporting of ocean sound (Consortium for Ocean Leadership (COL), 2018).\",\"682\":\"A team of international acousticians from academia, industry, and government came together to accept the challenge of developing such a user-friendly software package that incorporates user-specified calibration information to produce calibrated sound level products with associated metadata for both underwater and in-air recordings.\",\"683\":\"The goal was to develop a software package that would allow acousticians as well as those with minimal signal processing experience to transform raw acoustic recordings and their associated calibration information into calibrated sound level products without the need to develop software themselves.\",\"684\":\"The details of producing a simple time series of sound pressure levels (SPLs) can be difficult due to the different decisions that need to be made related to the processing details of temporal averaging window size, frequency bandwidth, and metric (e.g., SPL root-mean-square vs. SPL peak level) (Table 1).\",\"685\":\"The Making Ambient Noise Trends Accessible (MANTA) software provides a tool to the community that implements the technical recommendations of the workshops and enables calibrated comparisons between soundscapes and identification of ambient ocean sound trends needed by ocean stakeholders, researchers, and managers.\",\"686\":\"METHODS Making Ambient Noise Trends Accessible is provided for download in two forms that currently run on Windows operating systems1 (a macOS version is currently under development): (1) as a bundled set of MATLAB scripts (i.e., m-files) executed under MATLAB (version 2020b2 ), and (2) as a stand-alone, fully compiled executable that does not require the user to obtain a MATLAB license (i.e., it is completely free and anyone 1 Recommended minimum system requirements: Windows 10 operating system, 16 GB of RAM, 4-core CPU with 1.25 GHz base clock speed.\",\"687\":\"2 Required MATLAB toolboxes: Signal Processing, Image Processing Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning, and Parallel Computing.\",\"688\":\"Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org 2 August 2021 | Volume 8 | Article 703650 \\fMiksis-Olds et al.

Their extreme temperatures and rich chemistry provide a habitat to uniquely adapted marine life.  The soundscape at hydrothermal vents may influence the behavior of these organisms and has been suggested to act as an audible \u2018signpost\u2019 for larval settlement.  In addition, passive acoustic monitoring of hydrothermal vents may provide a method of long-term vent monitoring in the future.  Proposed deep-sea mining projects have the potential to disrupt the soundscape at sites such as hydrothermal vents.  For these reasons, it is important to document the baseline soundscape at hydrothermal vents.  In this work, long term passive acoustic monitoring at both the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vent Field and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are analyzed using the latest proposed underwater soundscape analysis techniques including spectral probability density, statistical measurements, long-term spectrograms and kurtosis, to provide a benchmark for future comparison and monitoring of healthy deep-sea hydrothermal vent soundscapes.", "history": "{\"filename\":{\"96\":\"Lin et al. - 2019 - Using Soundscapes to Assess Deep-Sea Benthic Ecosy.pdf\",\"44\":\"Lin et al. - 2019 - Using Soundscapes to
