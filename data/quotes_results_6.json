plays a critical role in Uber\\u2019s technology stack and it empowers a wide range of use cases.\",\"28\":\"At high level, real-time data processing needs within Uber consists of three broad areas: 1) Messaging platform that allows communication between asynchronous producers and subscribers 2) Stream processing that allows applying computational logic on top of such streams of messages and 3) OnLine Analytical Processing (OLAP) that enables analytical queries over all this data in near real time.\",\"29\":\"Each area has to deal with three fundamental scaling challenges within Uber: \\u2022 Scaling data: The total incoming real time data volume has been growing exponentially at a rapid rate of year over year produced by several thousands of micro services.\",\"30\":\"In addition, Uber deploys its infrastructure in several geographical regions for high availability, and it has a multiplication factor in terms of handling aggregate data.\",\"31\":\"Each real time processing

new use cases emerge from various business verticals and groups.\",\"33\":\"Different parts of the organization have varying requirements for the real time data systems, which are often competing in nature.\",\"34\":\"For instance, dynamic pricing[31] for a given Uber product (such as rides or eats) is a highly complex real-time workflow involving multi-stage stream processing pipelines that run various machine learning algorithms along with a fast keyvalue store.\",\"35\":\"This system is designed for favoring freshness and availability over data consistency, and it\\u2019s implemented entirely by engineers.\",\"36\":\"On the other hand, monitoring realtime business metrics around orders and sales requires a SQL like interface used by data scientists with more emphasis given to data completeness.\",\"37\":\"\\u2022 Scaling users: The diverse users interacting with the real time data system fall on a big spectrum of technical skills from operations personnel who have no engineering background to advanced users capable of orchestrating complex real time computational data pipelines.\",\"38\":\"As the personnel of Uber grows, the platform teams also face increasing challenges on the user imposed complexities, such as safe clientside version upgrade for a large number of applications and managing an increasing number of user requests.\",\"39\":\"In short, the biggest challenge is to build a unified platform with standard abstractions that can work for all such varied use cases and users at scale instead of creating custom solutions.\",\"40\":\"A key decision Industrial Track Paper SIGMOD \\u201921, June 20\\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China 2503 \\fmade by us to overcome such challenges is to adopt the open source solutions in building this

Uber\\u2019s data centers across multiple regions.\",\"45\":\"These streams of raw data form the source of truth for all analytics at Uber.\",\"46\":\"Most of these streams are incrementally archived in batch processing systems and ingested in the data warehouse.\",\"47\":\"This is then made available for machine learning and other data science use cases.\",\"48\":\"The Real Time Data Infra component continuously processes such data streams for powering a variety of mission critical use cases such as dynamic pricing (Surge), intelligent alerting, operational dashboards and so on.\",\"49\":\"This paper focuses on the real time data eco-system.\",\"50\":\"Figure 1: The high-level data flow at Uber infrastructure The paper is organized as follows.\",\"51\":\"In Section 2, we list the requirements derived from the use cases which are used to guide the design decisions for various real-time use cases.\",\"52\":\"In Section 3, we provide an overview of the high-level abstractions of the real-time data infrastructure at Uber.\",\"53\":\"In Section 4, we present the open source technologies that we adopted for each component in the architecture.\",\"54\":\"More importantly, we describe the enhancements and improvements on the open source solutions to overcome the scaling challenges faced by Uber.\",\"55\":\"In Section 5, we analyze several real-time use cases at Uber and show how their solutions are shaped differently due to unique design requirements.\",\"56\":\"We then discuss a few other important aspects of the real-time data infrastructure in Section 6 and Section 7.\",\"57\":\"Then in Section 8 we discuss related work and in Section 9, we reflect on lessons we learned about building and operating real-time systems at Uber.\",\"58\":\"Finally, we conclude in Section 10 and show the future work in Section 11.\",\"59\":\"2 REQUIREMENTS Each category of use case mentioned in Section 1 has its own special requirements pertaining to real-time data infrastructure which are often competing with those of other use cases.\",\"60\":\"The different requirements generally include the following aspects: \\u2022 Consistency: Mission-critical applications such as financial dashboards require data to be consistent across all regions.\",\"61\":\"This includes zero data loss in the inter-region and intraregion dispersal and processing mechanisms, de-duplication as well as ability to certify data quality.\",\"62\":\"\\u2022 Availability: The real time data infrastructure stack must be highly available with 99.99 percentile guarantee.\",\"63\":\"Loss of availability has a direct impact on Uber\\u2019s business and may result in significant financial losses.\",\"64\":\"For instance, dynamic pricing leverages the real-time data infrastructure component for calculating demand and supply ratios per geo-fence, which in turn is used to influence the price of a trip or UberEats delivery.\",\"65\":\"\\u2022 Data Freshness: Most of the use cases require seconds level freshness.\",\"66\":\"In other words a given event or log record must be available for processing or querying, seconds after it has been produced.\",\"67\":\"This is a critical requirement to ensure ability to respond to certain events such as security incidents, demandsupply skews, business metric alerts and so on.\",\"68\":\"\\u2022 Query latency: Some use cases need the ability to execute queries on the raw data stream and require the p99th query latency to be under 1 second.\",\"69\":\"For instance, site facing or external analytical tools such as UberEats Restaurant manager[53] will execute several analytical queries for each page load.\",\"70\":\"Each such query must be very fast to provide a good experience for the restaurant owner.\",\"71\":\"\\u2022 Scalability: The raw data streams constitute petabytes of data volume collected per day across all regions.\",\"72\":\"This data is constantly growing based on organic growth of our user base, new lines of business deployed by Uber as well as new real time analytics use cases that arise over time.\",\"73\":\"The ability to scale with this ever growing data set in a seamless manner, without requiring users to re-architect the processing pipelines is a fundamental requirement of the real-time data infrastructure stack.\",\"74\":\"\\u2022 Cost: Uber is a low margin business.\",\"75\":\"We need to ensure the cost of data processing and serving is low and ensure high operational efficiency.\",\"76\":\"This influences a variety of design decisions such as amount of data kept in memory, tiered storage, pre-materialization vs runtime computation and so on.\",\"77\":\"\\u2022 Flexibility: We need to provide programmatic as well as declarative (SQL like) interface for expressing computational logic to accommodate the diverse user groups.\",\"78\":\"In addition, some use cases need a push-based model which is semistateful and continuously emits generated results whereas others might need a stateful pull-based model where the user can execute queries on the raw data stream.\",\"79\":\"For instance, users can create intelligent alerts in case of business rule violation using push-based stream processing pipelines.\",\"80\":\"Whereas, dashboarding and triaging will require a pull-based SQL interface for the same datasets.\",\"81\":\"It\\u2019s easy to observe that guaranteeing all these requirements for the same use case is not possible.\",\"82\":\"For instance in the dynamic Industrial Track Paper SIGMOD \\u201921, June 20\\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China 2504 \\fpricing use case, we cannot guarantee both data consistency and freshness (availability) at Uber\\u2019s scale based on CAP theorem[36].\",\"83\":\"To minimize business impact, we must therefore prioritize freshness ahead of consistency.\",\"84\":\"Subsequently, each technology chosen for building this use case must be finely tuned for favouring freshness.\",\"85\":\"Such tradeoffs are discussed in detail in Section 5 by analyzing several real-time use cases at Uber.\",\"86\":\"3 ABSTRACTIONS The diagram in Figure 2 illustrates the logical building blocks that constitute a real-time analytics stack.\",\"87\":\"The different components (from bottom up) are as follows: Figure 2: An abstraction of the real-time data infrastructure and the overview of the components Storage.\",\"88\":\"This provides a generic object or blob storage interface for all the layers above it with a read after write consistency guarantee.\",\"89\":\"This is primarily used for long term storage of data and should be optimized for high write rate.\",\"90\":\"Reads are less frequent and used for cases such as bootstrapping data in an OLAP table or a stream, data backfills and so on.\",\"91\":\"Stream.\",\"92\":\"This provides a publish-subscribe interface to the higher layers.\",\"93\":\"Users of this layer can produce events to a particular stream or topic.\",\"94\":\"Any other user subscribing to this stream can consume the data one event at a time.\",\"95\":\"This system should be optimized for low latency for reads and writes.\",\"96\":\"The minimum requirements from this layer include ability to partition the data and at least once semantics between producer and subscriber.\",\"97\":\"Compute.\",\"98\":\"This provides the ability to perform arbitrary computation on the underlying stream and storage layers.\",\"99\":\"When computing over a stream, processing happens for each individual event whereas computation done directly over storage can be done in batches.\",\"100\":\"It\\u2019s important to note that we can choose the same or different technologies for stream processing vs storage or batch processing.\",\"101\":\"Choosing the same technology will result in simpler abstraction for the higher layers but results in higher complexity to implement - thus adding to significant operational overhead.\",\"102\":\"Whereas, choosing two different technologies makes the individual components feasible but delegates the task of federation to the higher layers.\",\"103\":\"The minimum requirements from this layer include at least once semantics between the data source and sink.\",\"104\":\"OLAP.\",\"105\":\"This layer provides a limited SQL capability over data coming from stream or storage.\",\"106\":\"The system should be optimized for serving analytical queries including filtering, aggregations with group by, order by in a high throughput, low latency manner.\",\"107\":\"The minimum requirements from this layer for the vast majority of use cases include at least once semantics while ingesting data from the different sources.\",\"108\":\"Exactly once data ingestion based on a primary key is a must have for a small set of critical use cases.\",\"109\":\"SQL.\",\"110\":\"This refers to a full SQL query layer on top of OLAP as well as compute.\",\"111\":\"When used with the compute layer, the SQL statement is compiled into a compute function which can be applied to the underlying stream or storage.\",\"112\":\"When used with the OLAP layer, it will do additional processing on top of the limited SQL provided, to fill in the gaps.\",\"113\":\"For instance, most real-time OLAP databases have limited or no join support, and this can be done at this SQL layer.\",\"114\":\"It\\u2019s interesting to note that joins can also be done in lower layers (prematerialize at the compute layer) and served by the OLAP layer without need for additional processing - albeit at a higher cost.\",\"115\":\"The minimum requirements from this layer include SQL semantics which are closer to ANSI SQL with extensions applicable for stream processing (for instance - window functions).\",\"116\":\"API.\",\"117\":\"This provides a programmatic way to access the stream or specify a compute function for the higher layer applications.\",\"118\":\"This is to be used by advanced users for whom the SQL interface is not sufficient.\",\"119\":\"It\\u2019s important to note that the choice of technologies in the layers below will have a direct impact on the simplicity of this API.\",\"120\":\"Metadata.\",\"121\":\"This provides a simple interface to manage all kinds of metadata required for all the aforementioned layers.\",\"122\":\"For instance, the schema that describes structured data managed by storage or stream will be stored here.\",\"123\":\"Minimum requirements include ability to version the metadata and have checks for ensuring backward compatibility across versions.\",\"124\":\"4 SYSTEM OVERVIEW Each following subsection introduces the open source systems we have adopted for the corresponding logical building block as shown in Figure 3.\",\"125\":\"We then subsequently describe Uber\\u2019s unique contributions in each domain and explain how it bridges the gaps to meet Uber\\u2019s unique scale and requirements.\",\"126\":\"4.1 Apache Kafka for streaming storage Kafka[45] is a popular open-source distributed event streaming system that is widely used in the industry.\",\"127\":\"In 2015 Kafka was already a popular solution known for good performance when we adopted it.\",\"128\":\"A more recent performance study can be found in this benchmark report from Confluent[15], which compared Kafka, Pulsar[12] and RabbitMQ[23] on system throughput and latency, the primary performance metrics for event streaming systems in production.\",\"129\":\"Besides the performance, there were several other important factors to consider for adoption, such as operational simplicity, open-source Industrial Track Paper SIGMOD \\u201921, June 20\\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China 2505 \\fFigure 3: Overview of the real-time data infrastructure at Uber ecosystem maturity, size of open-source community, adoption rate across the industry.\",\"130\":\"Looking at those together, Kafka was the clear winner among the queuing and event streaming systems.\",\"131\":\"Today at Uber, we have one of the largest deployments of Apache Kafka in the industry, with trillions of messages and Petabytes of data per day.\",\"132\":\"As the transport mechanism for sending streaming data to both batch and realtime systems, Kafka at Uber empowers a large number of different workflows, such as propagating event data from the rider and driver apps, enabling a streaming analytics platform (e.g. Apache Samza[13], Apache Flink), streaming database changelog to the downstream subscribers, ingesting all sorts of data into Uber\\u2019s Apache Hadoop Data Lake.\",\"133\":\"Due to Uber\\u2019s large scale, fault-tolerance considerations and some unique requirements, we customized Kafka and added the following enhancements.\",\"134\":\"4.1.1 Cluster federation.\",\"135\":\"To improve the availability and to tolerate single-cluster failure, we at Uber developed a novel federated Kafka cluster setup which hides the cluster details from producers\\/consumers.\",\"136\":\"Users do not need to know which cluster a topic resides in and the clients view a \\u201clogical cluster\\u201d.\",\"137\":\"A metadata server aggregates all the metadata information of the clusters and topics in a central place, so that it can transparently route the client\\u2019s request to the actual physical cluster.\",\"138\":\"In addition to reliability, cluster federation also improves scalability to support business growth.\",\"139\":\"Based on our empirical data, the ideal cluster size is less than 150 nodes for optimum performance.\",\"140\":\"With federation, the Kafka service can scale horizontally by adding more clusters when a cluster is full.\",\"141\":\"New topics are seamlessly created on the newly added clusters.\",\"142\":\"Lastly, cluster federation also brings the ease of topic management.\",\"143\":\"Inside Uber there are a large number of applications and clients, and it\\u2019s challenging to migrate a topic with live consumers between clusters.\",\"144\":\"Typically, this requires manual user coordination to shift their traffic to the new cluster, resulting in job restart.\",\"145\":\"Cluster federation enables consumer traffic redirection to another physical cluster without restarting the application.\",\"146\":\"4.1.2 Dead letter queue.\",\"147\":\"There are cases when some messages fail to be processed by downstream application, for example, due to message corruption or unexpected behavior.\",\"148\":\"In Apache Kafka\\u2019s model, there are two options to handle such failed messages: either drop those messages or retry indefinitely which blocks processing of the subsequent messages.\",\"149\":\"However, there are many scenarios in Uber that demand neither data loss nor clogged processing, such as trip receipt processing.\",\"150\":\"To accommodate such use cases, a Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) strategy was built on top of the Kafka interface[63].\",\"151\":\"If a consumer of the topic cannot process a message with several retries, it will publish that message to the dead letter topic.\",\"152\":\"The messages in the dead letter topic can be purged or merged (i.e. retried) on demand by the users.\",\"153\":\"This way, the unprocessed messages remain separate and therefore are unable to impede live traffic.\",\"154\":\"4.1.3 Consumer Proxy.\",\"155\":\"Open source Kafka includes a consumer library which packages sophisticated logic of batching and compression.\",\"156\":\"Though such client-side optimizations improves the consumer throughput, it brings a big challenge to large organizations like Uber regarding client management.\",\"157\":\"With tens of thousands of Kafka applications running, it\\u2019s tremendously difficult for the platform team to support the users in troubleshooting and debugging.\",\"158\":\"In addition, it slows down the development of the client library, as it takes months to upgrade the client library in all the applications.\",\"159\":\"Moreover, large organizations use many programming languages, so it\\u2019s hard to provide multi-language support when the clients are complex.\",\"160\":\"Lastly, due to Kafka\\u2019s architecture limitations, the opensource Kafka limits the number of the instances in a consumer group to no more than the number of the topic\\u2019s partition, and therefore puts a cap on consumer\\u2019s level of parallelism.\",\"161\":\"To address these challenges, we built a proxy layer that consumes messages from Kafka and dispatches them to a user-registered gRPC service endpoint for all the pub\\/sub use cases.\",\"162\":\"The complexities of the consumer library are encapsulated in the proxy layer, and applications only need to adopt a very thin, machine-generated gRPC client.\",\"163\":\"In particular, the consumer proxy provides sophisticated error handling.\",\"164\":\"When the downstream service fails to receive or process some messages, the consumer proxy can retry the dispatch, and send them to the DLQ if several retries failed.\",\"165\":\"Figure 4: Overview of the Kafka Consumer Proxy at Uber Another noticeable benefit of the consumer proxy is the change of delivery mechanism from message polling to push-based message dispatching, as shown in Figure 4.\",\"166\":\"Most pub\\/sub use cases inside Uber do not assume any dependencies among the messages.\",\"167\":\"As a result, a push-based dispatching mechanism can greatly improve the consumption throughput by enabling higher parallelism for slow consumers with negligible latency overhead.\",\"168\":\"This addresses Kafka\\u2019s consumer group size issue and allows significantly more concurrent processing opportunities to the applications.\",\"169\":\"4.1.4 Cross-cluster replication.\",\"170\":\"Given the large-scale use of Kafka within Uber, we ended up using multiple clusters in different data centers.\",\"171\":\"With this setup, the cross-cluster replication of Kafka messages is necessary for two reasons.\",\"172\":\"First, we need to look at the global view of this data for a variety of use cases.\",\"173\":\"For example, in order to compute business metrics related to trips, we need to gather information from all data centers and analyze it in one place.\",\"174\":\"Industrial Track Paper SIGMOD \\u201921, June 20\\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China 2506 \\fSecond, Kafka is also replicated for redundancy to tolerate cluster and datacenter failures.\",\"175\":\"To achieve this, we built and open-sourced a robust and performant replicator across the Kafka clusters called uReplicator[59].\",\"176\":\"uReplicator is designed for strong reliability and elasticity.\",\"177\":\"It has an in-built rebalancing algorithm so that it minimizes the number of the affected topic partitions during rebalancing.\",\"178\":\"Moreover, uReplicator is adaptive to the workload so that when there is bursty traffic it can dynamically redistribute the load to the standby workers for elasticity.\",\"179\":\"On top of this, to ensure there is no data loss from the crosscluster replication, we also developed and open sourced an end-toend auditing service called Chaperone[64].\",\"180\":\"Chaperone collects key statistics like the number of unique messages in a tumbling time window from every stage of the replication pipeline.\",\"181\":\"The auditing service compares the collected statistics and generates alerts when mismatch is detected.\",\"182\":\"With these improvements, we built a standardized and reliable streaming and messaging platform on top of Kafka to empower various use cases in real-time.\",\"183\":\"The future work in this area includes scaling up to multi regions across on-prem data centers and cloud, as well as better cost-efficiency architecture, which is discussed in section 11.\",\"184\":\"4.2 Apache Flink for stream processing In order to process all the real-time data coming through Kafka, we have built a stream processing platform on top of Apache Flink[42].\",\"185\":\"Apache Flink is an open-source, distributed stream processing framework with a high-throughput, low-latency engine widely adopted in the industry.\",\"186\":\"We adopted Apache Flink for a number of reasons.\",\"187\":\"First, it is robust enough to continuously support a large number of workloads with the built-in state management and checkpointing features for failure recovery.\",\"188\":\"Second, it is easy to scale and can handle back-pressure efficiently when faced with a massive input Kafka lag.\",\"189\":\"Third, it has a large and active open source community as well as a rich ecosystem of components and toolings.\",\"190\":\"Based on our comparisons done in 2016 with Apache Storm, Apache Spark and Apache Samza, Flink was deemed as the better choice of technology for this layer.\",\"191\":\"Storm performed poorly in handling back pressure when faced with a massive input backlog of millions of messages, taking several hours to recover whereas Flink only took 20 minutes.\",\"192\":\"Spark jobs consumed 5-10 times more memory than a corresponding Flink job for the same workload.\",\"193\":\"Samza had a strict dependency on Kafka for maintaining its internal state, which induced a significant operational overhead.\",\"194\":\"At Uber, we use Flink heavily for both facilitating customerfacing products and powering internal analytics with a wide range of insights captured from across the world and at all times, such as city-specific market conditions to global financial estimations.\",\"195\":\"The stream processing logic can be expressed by the users in 2 ways, a SQL dialect or a set of low-level APIs.\",\"196\":\"The SQL dialect is commonly used by different categories of users, technical and non-technical, such as engineers, data scientists, operations personnel, product managers and so on.\",\"197\":\"The more advanced users prefer to use the API for expressing complex logic as well as connecting to external systems such as databases, RPC endpoints, caches and so on.\",\"198\":\"To better support Uber use cases, we made the following contributions and improvements to Apache Flink.\",\"199\":\"4.2.1 Building streaming analytical applications with SQL.\",\"200\":\"One of the most important contributions we made was to introduce a layer on top of the Flink framework known as FlinkSQL[37].\",\"201\":\"This is now contributed back to Apache Flink project and it provides the ability to transform an input Apache Calcite[6] SQL query into an efficient Flink job.\",\"202\":\"The SQL processor compiles the queries to reliable, efficient, distributed Flink applications, and manages the full lifecycle of the application, allowing users to focus solely on their business logic.\",\"203\":\"Internally, it converts the input SQL query into a logical plan, runs it through the query optimizer and creates a physical plan which can be translated into a Flink job using the corresponding Flink API.\",\"204\":\"As a result, users of all technical levels can run their streaming processing applications in production in a span of mere hours regardless of scale.\",\"205\":\"These internal details are hidden from the user which has a big trade-off.\",\"206\":\"It makes adoption very easy since all the users need to understand is the data source, e.g. input Kafka topic, and the SQL syntax.\",\"207\":\"However, it adds significant operational overhead for the platform team to tune and maintain the production jobs.\",\"208\":\"In particular, we had to overcome the following challenges: Resource estimation and auto scaling The resource configurations such as allocated CPU and memory are important for the job health and also the cost efficiency.\",\"209\":\"We used empirical analysis for establishing a correlation between the common job types and the corresponding resource requirements.\",\"210\":\"For instance, a stateless Flink job which does not maintain any aggregation windows is CPU bound vs a stream-stream join job will almost always be memory bound.\",\"211\":\"We also observed that the job load may vary during peak and off-peak hours.\",\"212\":\"To maximize the cluster utilization, we employ continuous monitoring of the job load and garbage collection statistics, and perform auto-scaling when necessary.\",\"213\":\"Job monitoring and automatic failure recovery Since the end user does not know about the underlying Flink job and its job status, the platform needs to monitor the job and provide a strong reliability guarantee.\",\"214\":\"To address this, we built a component for automatically handling job failures when it detects a certain condition.\",\"215\":\"It is a rule-based engine which compares the Flink job\\u2019s key metrics such as resource usage against the desired state and takes corrective action such as restarting a stuck job or auto scaling.\",\"216\":\"Note that FlinkSQL has different semantics from the batch processing SQL systems such as Presto.\",\"217\":\"FlinkSQL is a stream processing engine wherein both the input and output are unbounded streams.\",\"218\":\"Whereas, batch processing engines query bounded datasets and output a bounded dataset.\",\"219\":\"One of the future work for FlinkSQL is to unify the streaming\\/batch processing semantics as discussed in section 11.\",\"220\":\"4.2.2 Unified architecture for deployment, management and operation.\",\"221\":\"Since we have provided two platforms to the users for building and managing the stream processing pipelines, we identified commonalities between the two and converged them into a unified architecture for deployment, management and operation.\",\"222\":\"The new unified platform also addressed several other challenges and resulted in a layered architecture for better extensibility and scalability as depicted in Figure 5.\",\"223\":\"Industrial Track Paper SIGMOD \\u201921, June 20\\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China 2507 \\fFigure 5: The layers of the Unified Flink architecture at Uber The Platform layer handles organizing the business logic and integration with other external platforms such as Machine learning feature training, workflow management and SQL compilation.\",\"224\":\"It consists of multiple business-specific components and can easily be extended to support new business requirements with additional components.\",\"225\":\"It transforms the specific business logic into standard Flink job definitions, and passes this to the next layer for validation and management.\",\"226\":\"The job management layer manages the Flink job\\u2019s lifecycle including validation, deployment, monitoring and failure recovery.\",\"227\":\"It offers a set of unified API abstractions for the platform layer (such as Start\\/Stop\\/List a job) and persists the job information including the state checkpoints and the metadata.\",\"228\":\"In addition, it serves as the proxy layer to the physical clusters and dispatches the jobs based on the job type, importance and priority.\",\"229\":\"Lastly, a shared component in the job management server continuously monitors the health of all jobs and automatically recovers the jobs from the transient failures.\",\"230\":\"The bottom layer is the infrastructure layer consisting of the compute clusters and storage backend.\",\"231\":\"It also provides the abstraction of the physical resources for flexibility and extensibility, regardless of the hosting infrastructure being on-prem or cloud.\",\"232\":\"For example, the compute clusters can be paired with different resource schedulers such as YARN and Uber\\u2019s Peloton[51].\",\"233\":\"Similarly, the storage backend can adopt HDFS, Amazon S3[2] or Google Cloud Storage[18] for the state checkpoints, to meet the various requirements for storage choice.\",\"234\":\"With these improvements, Flink has emerged as the de facto stream processing platform within Uber, powering several thousands of jobs with 30% year-over-year growth rate.\",\"235\":\"Based on user feedback, the current challenges in this layer include the need for seamless data backfills without writing additional code which is discussed in detail in Section 7.\",\"236\":\"Furthermore, some critical use cases need the ability to do a Flink job restart without any downtime which is an active area of investigation in the Flink community.\",\"237\":\"4.3 Apache Pinot for OLAP Apache Pinot[39] is an open-source, distributed, OnLine Analytical Processing (OLAP) system designed for performing low latency analytical queries on terabytes-scale data.\",\"238\":\"Pinot employs the lambda architecture to present a federated view between real-time and historical (offline) data.\",\"239\":\"As a column store, Pinot supports a number of fast indexing techniques, such as inverted, range, sorted and startree index[39], to answer the low-latency OLAP queries.\",\"240\":\"Pinot takes a scatter-gather-merge approach to query large tables in a distributed fashion: data is chunked by time boundary and grouped into segments; while the query is first decomposed into sub-plans which execute on the distributed segments in parallel, and then the plan results are aggregated and merged into a final one.\",\"241\":\"We decided to adopt Apache Pinot as our OLAP solution for several reasons.\",\"242\":\"During this time in 2018, the only other options available were Elasticsearch[17] and Apache Druid[65].\",\"243\":\"Based on our experimental evaluation and outside research, Apache Pinot has a smaller memory and disk footprint as well as supports significantly lower query latency SLA.\",\"244\":\"In particular: \\u2022 ElasticSearch: With the same amount of data ingested into Elasticsearch and Pinot, Elasitcsearch\\u2019s memory usage was 4x higher and disk usage was 8x higher than Pinot.\",\"245\":\"In addition, Elasticsearch\\u2019s query latency was 2x-4x higher than Pinot, benchmarked with a combination of filters, aggregation and group by\\/order by queries.\",\"246\":\"\\u2022 Apache Druid: Pinot is similar in architecture to Apache Druid but has incorporated optimized data structures such as bit compressed forward indices, for lowering the data footprint.\",\"247\":\"It also uses specialized indices for faster query execution such as Startree [39], sorted and range indices, which could result in order of magnitude difference of query latency.\",\"248\":\"Recent studies done outside of Uber also confirmed this performance benefit of Pinot over Druid [47] [61].\",\"249\":\"At Uber, Pinot powers a number of real-time analytics use cases.\",\"250\":\"Various products build their customized dashboards on Pinot for visualizing and exploring important metrics such as rides demandsupply, UberEats orders statistics and so on.\",\"251\":\"Another category of use cases stems from the need to execute analytical queries as part of many backend services.\",\"252\":\"The primary distinguishing requirement for such use cases is data freshness and query latency which needs to be real-time in nature.\",\"253\":\"For example, identifying rider cancellation or abandoned UberEats carts instantly, enables quick corrective action in the form of messaging and incentives.\",\"254\":\"We have contributed the following enhancements to Apache Pinot to handle Uber\\u2019s unique requirements around high availability, rich query support and exactly once semantics (i.e. upserts).\",\"255\":\"4.3.1 Upsert support.\",\"256\":\"Upsert is a common requirement by many use cases inside Uber, such as correcting a ride fare and updating a delivery status.\",\"257\":\"We designed and developed a scalable upsert solution on Pinot, so that records can be updated during the realtime ingestion into the OLAP store.\",\"258\":\"To the best of our knowledge, Apache Pinot is the only open-source real-time OLAP store that supports upsert.\",\"259\":\"The key technical challenge for upsert is tracking the locations of the records with the same primary key.\",\"260\":\"In a realtime system, it\\u2019s very complicated and inefficient to keep track of these locations in a centralized manner and coordinate with distributed storage nodes.\",\"261\":\"To overcome this challenge, we organize the input stream into multiple partitions by the primary key, and distribute each partition to a node for processing.\",\"262\":\"As a result, all the records with the same primary key are assigned to the same node.\",\"263\":\"On top of that, we introduced a new routing strategy that dispatches Industrial Track Paper SIGMOD

they lead to a shared-nothing solution to this problem in Pinot.\",\"265\":\"This sharednothing solution has many advantages, including better scalability, elimination of single point of failure, and ease of operation.\",\"266\":\"4.3.2 Full SQL support .\",\"267\":\"Pinot is an OLAP system that excels at low-latency queries with a rich set of indexing technique support.\",\"268\":\"However, it lacks several notable SQL features such as subqueries and joins.\",\"269\":\"To fill this gap, we have integrated Pinot with Presto for enabling standard PrestoSQL queries on Pinot tables[62].\",\"270\":\"In fact, Presto is the defacto query engine for interactive queries within Uber.\",\"271\":\"This combination works great since we can combine Pinot\\u2019s seconds level data freshness with Presto\\u2019s flexibility in doing complicated queries.\",\"272\":\"In addition, predicate pushdowns and aggregation function pushdowns enable us to achieve sub-second query latencies

create Pinot offline tables from Hive datasets via Spark.\",\"279\":\"4.3.4 Peer-to-peer segment recovery.\",\"280\":\"The original design of Apache Pinot introduced a strict dependency on an external archival or \\u201csegment store\\u201d such as HDFS, Amazon S3, Google GCS and so on.\",\"281\":\"During real time data ingestion, completed segments had to be synchronously backed up to this segment store to recover from any subsequent failures.\",\"282\":\"In addition, this backup was done through one single controller.\",\"283\":\"Needless to say, this was a huge scalability bottleneck and caused data freshness violation.\",\"284\":\"Moreover, any segment store failures caused all data ingestion to come to a halt.\",\"285\":\"Our team designed and implemented an asynchronous solution wherein server replicas can serve the archived segments in case of failures.\",\"286\":\"Thus, we replaced a centralized segment store with a peer-to-peer scheme, while still maintaining the same guarantees around data and query consistency.\",\"287\":\"Lastly, this also solved the single node backup bottleneck and significantly improved overall data freshness.\",\"288\":\"With these improvements, Pinot adoption has grown significantly within Uber.\",\"289\":\"In 2 years since it was introduced in our Data stack, the data footprint has grown from dozens of GBs of data to over several hundreds of TBs of data.\",\"290\":\"At the same time the query workload has grown from a few hundreds of QPS (Queries Per Second) to tens of thousands of QPS.\",\"291\":\"Our team continues to address the growing needs within Uber and are currently working on the following challenges: Ability to perform low latency joins: Currently joins are performed by Presto, which federates query execution across Pinot and Hive.\",\"292\":\"However, this is done entirely in-memory in the Presto worker and cannot be used for critical use cases.\",\"293\":\"We are contributing the ability to perform lookup joins to Pinot to support joining tables with commonly used dimension tables.\",\"294\":\"Semistructured (e.g. JSON) data support: Users currently rely on a Flink job to preprocess an input Kafka topic with nested JSON format into a flattened-schema Kafka topic for Pinot ingestion.\",\"295\":\"We are working with the community in building native JSON support for both ingestion and queries.\",\"296\":\"4.4 HDFS for archival store In Uber, we use HDFS as the long term storage for all the Data.\",\"297\":\"Most of this data comes from Kafka which is in Avro format and is persisted in HDFS as raw logs.\",\"298\":\"These logs are then merged into the long term Parquet data format using a compaction process and made available via standard processing engines such as Hive, Presto or Spark.\",\"299\":\"Such datasets constitute the source of truth for all analytical data.\",\"300\":\"This is used to backfill data in Kafka, Pinot and even some OLTP or key-value store data sinks.\",\"301\":\"In addition, HDFS is used by other platforms for managing their own persistent storage.\",\"302\":\"For instance, Apache Flink uses HDFS for maintaining the job checkpoints.\",\"303\":\"This consists of all the input stream offsets as well as snapshots of the Flink job\\u2019s internal state per container.\",\"304\":\"Furthermore, Apache Pinot uses HDFS for long term segment archival which is crucial for correcting failed replicas or during server bootstrap.\",\"305\":\"4.5 Presto for Interactive Query Traditionally, in the big data ecosystem a distributed SQL query engine such as Hive[9] is used for processing batch datasets where the emphasis is on query flexibility rather than ingestion or query latency.\",\"306\":\"In the recent years, there have been increasing demands on the interactive analytics workloads to derive the insights in a quick manner and at Uber we adopted Presto[57] as the interactive query engine solution.\",\"307\":\"Presto is an open source, distributed query engine originally developed by Facebook.\",\"308\":\"Presto was designed from the ground up for fast analytical queries against large scale datasets by employing a Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) engine and performing all computations in-memory, thus avoiding materialization overhead of writing intermediate results to disk.\",\"309\":\"Moreover, Presto is designed to be flexible and extensible.\",\"310\":\"It provides a Connector API with high performance I\\/O interface to multiple data sources, including Hadoop data warehouses, RDBMSs and NoSQL systems.\",\"311\":\"In the case of Uber, data scientists and engineers often want to do exploration on real-time data to enhance the sensitivity of the corresponding features or models.\",\"312\":\"In order to achieve this, we have leveraged Presto\\u2019s connector model and built a Pinot connector to deeply integrate with Apache Pinot so that we can execute standard Presto SQL queries on fresh data.\",\"313\":\"One challenge we overcame during this connector development is to be intelligent and selective on which parts of the physical plan can be pushed down to the Pinot layer.\",\"314\":\"Our first version of this connector only included predicate pushdown given the limited connector API.\",\"315\":\"In order to lower query latency and leverage Pinot\\u2019s Industrial Track Paper SIGMOD \\u201921, June 20\\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China 2509 \\ffast indexing, we enhanced Presto\\u2019s query planner and extended Presto Connector API to push as many operators down to the Pinot layer as possible, such as projection, aggregation and limit.\",\"316\":\"5 USE CASES ANALYSIS In this section, we present several different real-time use cases across the 4 broad categories (as in Figure 2) in production at Uber, and show how they use the different systems to achieve their business goals.\",\"317\":\"Also, we discuss the design tradeoffs considered by those use cases.\",\"318\":\"5.1 Analytical Application: Surge Pricing The surge[35] use case is a dynamic pricing mechanism in Uber ride-hailing marketplace to balance the supply of available drivers with the demand for rides.\",\"319\":\"On the rider side, surge pricing reduces the demand to match the level of available drivers and maintains the reliability of the marketplace.\",\"320\":\"On the driver side, it encourages drivers to drive during certain hours and locations, as drivers earn more during surge.\",\"321\":\"Surge pricing is essentially a streaming pipeline for computing the pricing multipliers per hexagon-area geofence based on the trip data, rider and driver status in a time window.\",\"322\":\"The surge pricing pipeline ingests streaming data from Kafka, runs a complex machine-learning based algorithm in Flink, and stores the result in a sink key-value store for quick result look up.\",\"323\":\"The surge pricing favors data freshness and availability over data consistency.\",\"324\":\"The late-arriving messages do not contribute to the surge computation and the pipeline must meet a strict end-to-end latency SLA requirement on the calculation per time window.\",\"325\":\"This tradeoff is reflected in the design that the surge pricing pipeline uses the Kafka cluster configured for higher throughput but not lossless guarantee, as well as an active-active setup for higher availability which is described in Section 6.\",\"326\":\"5.2 Dashboards: UberEats Restaurant Manager Dashboards are popular for observing trends and spotting anomalies at a glance.\",\"327\":\"And at Uber, many engineering teams build customized dashboards using the real-time analytics systems.\",\"328\":\"Among them, UberEats restaurant manager is a good representative example.\",\"329\":\"This dashboard enables the owner of a Restaurant to get insights from the UberEats orders regarding customer satisfaction, popular menu items, sales and service quality analysis, via generated interactive, slice-and-dice queries.\",\"330\":\"At a high level, the restaurant manager demands fresher data and low query latency, but does not require too much flexibility as the patterns of the generated queries are fixed.\",\"331\":\"To meet the requirements, we used Pinot with the efficient pre-aggregation indices of the large volume of raw records, in order to reduce the serving time.\",\"332\":\"Also, we built preprocessors in Flink such as aggressive filtering, partial aggregate and roll-ups to further reduce the processing time in Pinot and meet the latency SLA.\",\"333\":\"With such preprocessing, we trade the query flexibility required for ad-hoc exploration and complexity of query evolution for lower latency.\",\"334\":\"In general, there is a tradeoff between processing at the transformation time, as done by Flink, and processing at query time, as done by Pinot.\",\"335\":\"The preprocessing during transformation time can Table 1: The

learning (ML) has been playing a crucial role within Uber to create seamless, impactful experiences for our customers[40].\",\"337\":\"To ensure ML model quality, it is critical to monitor its predictions so as to ensure that the data pipelines are continuing to send accurate data.\",\"338\":\"To address this, a real-time prediction monitoring pipeline is set up that joins the predictions to the observed outcomes (or labels) generated by the data pipeline, creating ongoing, live measurements of model accuracy.\",\"339\":\"The key requirement from this use case is scalability, due to a high volume and high cardinality of data to be processed.\",\"340\":\"With thousands of ML models deployed and each model with hundreds of features, there are several hundreds of thousands of time series with millions of data points computed per second, far beyond the capability of the time-series database inside Uber.\",\"341\":\"Thanks to the horizontal scalability of Flink, we deployed a large streaming job to aggregate the metrics and detect prediction abnormality.\",\"342\":\"To boost the query performance over the large number of data points, the Flink job also creates pre-aggregation as Pinot tables.\",\"343\":\"This real-time prediction monitoring pipeline represents a large number of use cases that build real-time OLAP cubes with preaggregates and indices in Pinot, to speed up query execution time and throughput for large scale datasets.\",\"344\":\"5.4 Ad-hoc Exploration: UberEats Ops Automation The UberEats team needed a way to execute ad hoc analytical queries on real time data generated by couriers, restaurants and eaters.\",\"345\":\"Once an insight was discovered, a subsequent need was to productionize the query in a rule-based automation framework.\",\"346\":\"This was a critical component used by the Ops team to combat Covid 19 and keep restaurants open in different geographical locations like Europe.\",\"347\":\"To comply with regulation and safety rules, Uber needed to limit the number of customers and couriers at a restaurant.\",\"348\":\"The ops team was able to identify such metrics using Presto on top of real-time data managed by Pinot and then inject such queries into the automation framework.\",\"349\":\"Industrial Track Paper SIGMOD \\u201921, June 20\\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China 2510 \\fThis framework uses Pinot to aggregate needed statistics for a given geographical location in the past few minutes and then generates alerts and notifications to the couriers and restaurants accordingly.\",\"350\":\"Thus the same infrastructure provided a seamless path from ad-hoc exploration to production rollout.\",\"351\":\"Needless to say, the underlying system has to be extremely reliable and scalable since this decision making process is critical not only to the business but also for the safety of the customers.\",\"352\":\"Pinot, Presto and Flink were able to scale easily with the organic data growth and performed reliably during peak hours.\",\"353\":\"To summarize, Table 1 shows the components in the real-time infrastructure used by the representative use case for each category.\",\"354\":\"6 ALL-ACTIVE STRATEGY Providing business resilience and continuity is a top priority for Uber.\",\"355\":\"Disaster recovery plans are built carefully to minimize the business impact from natural and man-made disasters, such as power outages, catastrophic software failures and network outages.\",\"356\":\"At Uber, we rely on a multi-region strategy that ensures services are deployed with backup in data centers geographically distributed, and when the physical infrastructure in one region is unavailable, the service can still stay up and running from other regions.\",\"357\":\"The foundation of this multi-region real-time architecture is a multi-region Kafka setup that provides data redundancy and traffic continuation support for its clients.\",\"358\":\"In fact, the majority of the services in the stack above depend on Kafka for the active\\/active setup.\",\"359\":\"For example, Figure 6 below shows how Uber\\u2019s dynamic pricing service (i.e. surge pricing) uses active-active Kafka to build the disaster recovery plan.\",\"360\":\"All the trip events are sent over to the Kafka regional cluster and then aggregated into the aggregate clusters for the global view.\",\"361\":\"Then in each region a complex Flink job with large-memory footprint will compute the pricing for different areas.\",\"362\":\"Each region has an instance of \\u2018update service\\u2019 and one of them is labelled as primary by an all-active coordinating service.\",\"363\":\"The update service from the primary region stores the pricing result in an active\\/active database for quick lookup.\",\"364\":\"Figure 6: The active-active setup for surge pricing When disaster strikes the primary region, the active-active service assigns another region to be the primary, and the surge pricing calculation fails over to another region.\",\"365\":\"It\\u2019s important to note that the computation state of the Flink job is too large to be synchronously replicated between regions, and therefore its state must be computed independently from the input messages from the aggregate clusters.\",\"366\":\"Given that the input to the Flink job from aggregate Kafka is consistent across all regions, the output state converges.\",\"367\":\"This approach is compute intensive since we\\u2019re running redundant pipelines in each region.\",\"368\":\"The other strategy is to consume Kafka in an active\\/passive mode: only one consumer (identified by a unique name) is allowed to consume from the aggregate clusters in one of the regions designated as the primary region at a time.\",\"369\":\"When disaster happens, the service can fail over to another region and resume its consumption progress.\",\"370\":\"Such active\\/passive mode is desirable for the services that favor strong consistency such as payment processing and auditing.\",\"371\":\"Figure 7: The active-passive setup for stronger consistency As the consumption progress is represented by the offset of the Kafka topic, the key challenge of the active\\/passive strategy is offset synchronization of consumers across regions.\",\"372\":\"Because many services at Uber cannot accept any data loss, in case of a failover, the consumer can neither resume from the high watermark (i.e. the latest messages), nor from the low watermark (i.e. the earliest messages) to avoid too much backlog.\",\"373\":\"In order to overcome the challenge of offset mappings across the regions, we developed a sophisticated offset management service at Uber.\",\"374\":\"As shown in Figure 7, when uReplicator (introduced in section 4.1.4) replicates messages from source cluster to the destination cluster, it periodically checkpoints the offset mapping from source to destination in an active-active database.\",\"375\":\"Meanwhile, an offset sync job periodically synchronizes the offsets between the two regions for the active-passive consumers.\",\"376\":\"So when an active\\/passive consumer fails over from one region to another, the consumer can take the latest synchronized offset and resume the consumption.\",\"377\":\"7 BACKFILL There is a recurring need to go back in time and reprocess the stream data at Uber, for several reasons.\",\"378\":\"First, a new data process pipeline often needs to test against the existing data, or a new machine Industrial Track Paper SIGMOD \\u201921, June 20\\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China 2511 \\flearning model often needs to be trained with a few months of data.\",\"379\":\"To save time and be able to iterate faster, the testing or training is done on historic data that is already available.\",\"380\":\"Second, sometimes a bug may be discovered in a real-time application that has already processed the data for a period.\",\"381\":\"In such cases there could be a desire to reprocess some\\/all of the data separately after fixing the bug.\",\"382\":\"Third, similar to the previous case, there can be a change of stream processing logic that necessitates reprocessing of old data.\",\"383\":\"The backfill problem appears to be a common problem wherever there is realtime big data processing.\",\"384\":\"Lambda[49] and Kappa[52] architectures have been proposed in this respect but both suffer from limitations.\",\"385\":\"Lambda architecture maintains two separate systems: one for batch, and one for stream processing.\",\"386\":\"This leads to maintenance and consistency issues when trying to keep both implementations in sync.\",\"387\":\"Kappa architecture improves upon this by using the same streaming code for both real-time and backfill processing but requires very long data retention in Kafka and may not be very efficient in terms of processing throughput.\",\"388\":\"Given the scale of data generated into Kafka at Uber and the operational concerns regarding node replacement, we limit Kafka retention to only a few days.\",\"389\":\"Therefore, we\\u2019re unable to adopt the Kappa architecture.\",\"390\":\"At Uber, we built a solution for ease of backfill for stream processing use cases using Flink which has 2 modes of operations: \\u2022 SQL based: We added the ability to execute the same SQL query on both real-time (Kafka) and offline datasets (Hive).\",\"391\":\"In this case, the FlinkSQL compiler will translate the SQL query to two different Flink jobs: one using DataStream API and the other using DataSet API.\",\"392\":\"Although this is similar to Lambda architecture, the user does not need to maintain 2 distinct jobs.\",\"393\":\"\\u2022 API based: This solution is internally named as Kappa+[52].\",\"394\":\"The Kappa+ architecture is able to reuse the stream processing logic just like Kappa architecture but it can directly read archived data from offline datasets such as Hive.\",\"395\":\"The Kappa+ architecture addressed several issues on processing the batch datasets with streaming logic, such as identifying the start\\/end boundary of the bounded input, handling the higher throughput from the historic data with throttling, fine tuning job memory as the offline data could be out of order and therefore demand larger window for buffering.\",\"396\":\"Effectively, using Kappa+ we can execute the same code with minor config changes on both streaming or batch data sources.\",\"397\":\"This is an active area of investigation and there are lots of edge cases that need to be handled in both these solutions.\",\"398\":\"A full evaluation of each approach is out of scope of this paper.\",\"399\":\"8 RELATED WORK Real-time data infrastructure spans a wide range of components, and there are plentiful related systems in each area.\",\"400\":\"Messaging systems.\",\"401\":\"Traditional enterprise messaging systems ActiveMQ[3] RabbitMQ[23] Oracle Enterprise Messaging Service[22] IBM Websphere MQ[19] have existed for a long time and often play a critical role as an event bus for processing asynchronous data flows.\",\"402\":\"However, none of those are comparable to Kafka on features, ecosystem and system performance.\",\"403\":\"Recently, a new messaging system Apache Pulsar[12] emerged with a novel tiered architecture[56] that decouples data serving and data storage for better elasticity and easier operation.\",\"404\":\"However, Pulsar is still relatively new and not as mature as Kafka.\",\"405\":\"Stream Processing Systems.\",\"406\":\"The need for highly-scalable stream processing systems has led to the creation of a number of systems in the recent years, including both open-source software like Storm[14], Samza[13], Heron[46], Spark Streaming[68], Apex[4], and the home-grown ones from large internet companies like Google\\u2019s Photon[25], Facebook\\u2019s Puma\\/Swift[30], Amazon\\u2019s Kinesis[1].\",\"407\":\"In addition to overcoming the challenges of scalability, efficiency and fault tolerance, another important ongoing trend for these systems is the unification of streaming and batch processing.\",\"408\":\"Systems like Apache Flink[27] are expanding its architecture to support batch processing use cases, while frameworks like Dataflow[24] and Apache Beam[5] approach this via an abstraction layer over different processing engines.\",\"409\":\"Real-time OLAP Systems.\",\"410\":\"Real-time OLAP systems have become popular in recent years, as modern businesses need to quickly transform freshly obtained data into insights.\",\"411\":\"Apache Druid[65] and Clickhouse[16] are the open source systems commonly adopted in the industry.\",\"412\":\"They are like Pinot to buffer ingested streams and utilize column stores to achieve efficient column scans.\",\"413\":\"Helios[54] is a similar real-time OLAP store developed and used at Microsoft.\",\"414\":\"Another way to improve the performance of the OLAP system is to pre-aggregate data into cubes, then perform query execution on the pre-aggregated data [11].\",\"415\":\"However, such performance improvements come at the expense of query inflexibility.\",\"416\":\"HTAP databases are another category of emerging systems to unify transactional and analytical processing in a single system [43] [38] [34].\",\"417\":\"However, one challenge is to have a clean separation of the two to

learned many lessons in our journey of building and scaling the real-time data infrastructure at Uber.\",\"438\":\"9.1 Open source adoption As seen before, most of the real-time analytics stack and in fact the larger data stack in Uber has been built on open source technologies.\",\"439\":\"The primary reason behind this philosophy is the need to iterate quickly.\",\"440\":\"The engineering needs at Uber are constantly evolving and the ability to deliver a quick solution is crucial.\",\"441\":\"Relying on open source gives us a strong foundation to build upon and reduces the time to market.\",\"442\":\"Naturally, this also helps in handling churn in a graceful way.\",\"443\":\"However, this is not without its challenges.\",\"444\":\"In our experience, most open source technologies were built for a specific purpose and at Uber, we had to make it work for a lot of dimensions such as a wide spectrum of use cases, programming language, Uber\\u2019s underlying infrastructure, security aspects and so on.\",\"445\":\"For instance, Apache Kafka (circa 2014) was meant to be used primarily for log propagation and used with Java applications.\",\"446\":\"We had to build a RESTful ecosystem around Kafka to make it work with 4 languages: Java, Python, Go and NodeJS which was in use at Uber.\",\"447\":\"This also meant we had to invest in building our own throttling mechanism, metadata discovery, client side failure handling and so on.\",\"448\":\"In addition, we customized the core routing and replication mechanism to handle specialized use cases such as zero data loss for financial data, dead letter queue on top of Kafka.\",\"449\":\"Other such examples of customization include integrating with Uber\\u2019s container ecosystem, security policies, building a full SQL layer on top of Apache Pinot for our non engineering audience and seamless backfill using Apache Flink.\",\"450\":\"9.2 Rapid system development and evolution For a large company like Uber, it\\u2019s common to see multiple driving forces to the architecture evolution, such as new business requirements, industrial trends, regulation and compliance, and growth.\",\"451\":\"As a result, one lesson we learned is on the importance of enabling rapid software development so that each system can evolve quickly and independently.\",\"452\":\"On the client side, it\\u2019s important to set up best practices to manage the large fleet of applications.\",\"453\":\"First, interface standardization is critical so that a clean boundary is established between the services to minimize the risks of breaking the clients.\",\"454\":\"At Uber, we leverage Monorepo[20] to manage all projects in a single code repository, in order to review the changes by the stakeholders and detect the issues early.\",\"455\":\"Second, a thin client is always preferred in order to reduce the frequency of the client upgrades.\",\"456\":\"For example, upgrading Kafka clients used to take several months prior to the introduction of a RESTful, thin Kafka client.\",\"457\":\"Third, language consolidation is another strategy we employ to reduce the number of clients and ways to interact with the system.\",\"458\":\"For low-level programming languages, we purposely reduced the support to only two languages Java and Golang; and for high-level SQL languages, we chose PrestoSQL as the common

described in Section 4.1.4.\",\"480\":\"This makes it very easy for users to detect issues across all of Uber\\u2019s data centers.\",\"481\":\"Seamless onboarding.\",\"482\":\"Kafka topics used for application logs are automatically provisioned when the corresponding service is deployed in the production environment.\",\"483\":\"These topics are also automatically expanded as the usage increases

scheme.\",\"492\":\"Scaling use cases We invested heavily in flexibility of use of individual technologies for powering varied use cases described above.\",\"493\":\"For instance, with the same client protocol (Apache Kafka consumer) we\\u2019re able to serve a wide spectrum of use cases from logging which trades off data consistency for achieving high availability, to disseminating financial data that needs zero data loss guarantees in a multi region ecosystem.\",\"494\":\"Similarly, Pinot provides a low latency OLAP layer for mission-critical use cases as well as enables real-time data exploration via Presto integration.\",\"495\":\"Each such technology can be finely tuned depending on the exact set of requirements.\",\"496\":\"Scaling users Finally, we were able to add a layer of indirection between our users and the underlying technologies using abstractions and standard interfaces, greatly reducing the user support cost.\",\"497\":\"For instance, the introduction of the FlinkSQL layer enabled data scientists and operations personnel to spin up complex Flink pipelines in a matter of a few hours with just basic SQL knowledge.\",\"498\":\"Anyone within Uber can use PrestoSQL to query data across Pinot and other data systems (eg: Hive) in a seamless manner.\",\"499\":\"Backfilling data across regions is as simple as clicking a button for executing the same query or code in a historical fashion.\",\"500\":\"Moreover, these abstractions provide an extensible framework for us to evolve the underlying technologies and implement future optimizations such as tiered storage.\",\"501\":\"11 FUTURE WORK Our systems continue to evolve to serve our users better.\",\"502\":\"We have identified a few areas that we will invest strategically in and provide better solutions.\",\"503\":\"Streaming and batch processing unification There are several use cases that demand both batch and stream processing, such as the lambda architecture and offline\\/real-time feature computing for machine learning.\",\"504\":\"It\\u2019s common for the users to express the same processing logic twice in different languages and run on different compute frameworks.\",\"505\":\"A unified processing solution will ease the development and pipeline management.\",\"506\":\"Multi-region and multi-zone deployments We are working on a multi-region-multi-zone strategy to push the scalability and reliability of our real-time data infrastructure to the next level to tolerate zone-level and region-level disasters.\",\"507\":\"The biggest challenge here is to optimize data placement in order to balance data redundancy for reliability and storage cost due to excessive copies.\",\"508\":\"On-prem and cloud agnostic In recent years, the ability to run system infrastructure in the cloud environment has gained a lot of importance.\",\"509\":\"At Uber, we are also looking at cloud adoption and are investigating ways of converting the systems to be agnostic of data centers or cloud, so that we can move freely from on-prem to cloud.\",\"510\":\"Tiered storage Storage tiering improves both cost efficiency by storing colder data in a cheaper storage medium as well as elasticity by separating data storage and serving layers.\",\"511\":\"We are actively investigating tiered storage solutions for both Kafka and Pinot and collaborating closely with the open source community in this regard.\",\"512\":\"12 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Realtime data infrastructure at Uber is an evolving architecture of multi-year effort from several teams.\",\"513\":\"Many engineers,

INTRODUCTION The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and its maritime security partners keep watch over the longest coastline in the world.\",\"703\":\"Capturing vessel characteristics, such as location, identity, and cargo, for incoming surface traffic is an essential part of the defence mandate and represents a Canadian contribution to international agreements for defence of North America.\",\"704\":\"This is no small task given that Canada hosts and borders some of the busiest ports in North America.\",\"705\":\"Over seven million containers a year pass through the Juan de Fuca Strait to Vancouver, Port Rupert and Tacoma\\/Seattle port complexes [1], while the ports of Halifax and Montreal see combined container traffic of two million containers per year [2][3].\",\"706\":\"Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) is in part built from the aggregation of individual vessel characteristics in areas of interest.\",\"707\":\"In Canada, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) represents this broad scale knowledge of vessels within an area, with MDA defined as \\u201cthe effective understanding of anything associated with the maritime domain that could impact the security, safety, economy or environment of Canada\\u201d [4].\",\"708\":\"Within Canada, the tools used by the RCN to maintain knowledge of these vessel characteristics has recently undergone a considerable enhancement.\",\"709\":\"This was in large part due to the introduction of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) [5] on vessels.\",\"710\":\"AIS requires a vessel to broadcast over Very High Frequency (VHF) radio links, its position, destination, identity and other vessel characteristics using a vocabulary of twenty-seven message types.\",\"711\":\"The AIS reporting rates vary but can be as frequent as every two seconds.\",\"712\":\"The result is an introduction of large volumes of vessel data that are relevant to the ongoing RCN commitment to the defence and security of the nation.\",\"713\":\"The adoption of international AIS standards created an industry.\",\"714\":\"In the late 2000\\u2019s, companies like exactEarth launched satellites capable of space-based AIS collection [6][7].\",\"715\":\"This combined with the ongoing deployment of terrestrial receivers, gave maritime security personnel unprecedented access to ship information.\",\"716\":\"Unfortunately, legacy vessel tracking systems across militaries were finding the data volumes a challenge, in large part because these systems were built to hold the information from a few thousand vessels detected by sensors on a single platform [8][9].\",\"717\":\"Fortunately, the development of AIS coincided (more-orless) with a geospatial revolution in computing.\",\"718\":\"The introduction of digital mapping applications, and consumer friendly geospatial products like Google Earth, raised users\\u2019 expectations when accessing and visualising location data at scale.\",\"719\":\"The software techniques used to deliver these new services were quickly emulated, and many products developed for national security communities were released under liberal use licenses, further stimulating improvements in geospatial data handling [10].\",\"720\":\"The impact of large volume AIS data on legacy systems provided the motivation for the following work.\",\"721\":\"The evolution of geospatial tools provided the research question: Could the new generation of geospatial technologies be used to minimize the impact of large volume geospatial data on the legacy systems?\",\"722\":\"This effort demonstrates how challenges associated with data volumes and velocity can be mitigated using such open source technologies.\",\"723\":\"This work illustrates the use of many geospatial technologies, joined in a particular manner to address a specific requirement.\",\"724\":\"The resulting system, named the Geospatial Communication Interface

conclusion.\",\"736\":\"II.\",\"737\":\"UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM A.\",\"738\":\"Related systems There are very few papers that outline a general technical framework for maritime positional data handling.\",\"739\":\"Much of the past scientific focus has been to illustrate data exploitation methods, where algorithms and processing techniques are assembled to deliver a specific scientific outcome.\",\"740\":\"There are many examples of this including use of space-based sensing for MDA [11], the creation and analysis of vessel tracks from spatial-temporal position reports [12], or the use of AIS for extraction of maritime routes [13].\",\"741\":\"In terms of information systems that help provide a window on maritime traffic, many of the system level descriptions subordinate data handling techniques to the solution of a specific military problem.\",\"742\":\"For example, the goal of Command and Control (C2) drives the effort towards applications such as the Global Command and Control System, the Maritime Tactical Command and Control System [14], or the NATO Maritime Command, Control and Information System (MCCIS) [15].\",\"743\":\"These systems may include a data handling component as part of the system, but this component is typically undocumented and tightly bound to a monolithic (not modular) application.\",\"744\":\"The Maritime Safety and Security Information System (MSSIS) [16] is similar to GCI+ in that it joins large volumes of AIS data and deals with aggregation of heterogeneous maritime data.\",\"745\":\"Also, the NATO Baseline for Rapid Iterative

operations and fine-grained windowing support, and (iii) several extensions on traditional temporal operations that are useful for physiological data processing such as extending Where operator to query visual patterns and shapes in data streams as shown in Figure 4 (see Section 6.1 for more details).\",\"1091\":\"LifeStream provides the data abstraction that consists of a stream of events in chronological order.\",\"1092\":\"An event is a single unit of data with three fields: (i) a user-defined payload, (ii) a sync time, which dictates the time from which that particular event is active,

means the sync time of every event is always at the period boundaries.\",\"1095\":\"Since each event\\u2019s position in a stream is predictable, we use the symbolic representation of (offset, period)

waveform data, any streaming data that can be represented in the aforementioned format can take advantage of the benefits of LifeStream.\",\"1097\":\"This includes periodic streaming datasets such as performance counters produced in data centers [18], data collected from wearable devices [17], and real-time sensor data [36].\",\"1098\":\"One of the key design choices we make in LifeStream is to decouple the operator implementation from the data representation used for storing stream data.\",\"1099\":\"Most of the streaming engines, such as Trill [11] and Spark streaming [5] implement their

interval and a fixed size or duration.\",\"1108\":\"Since FWindow is an interval on a stream, the size of the FWindow should always be a multiple of the period of the stream.\",\"1109\":\"In LifeStream, we implement all the operations based on FWindows\\u2014the operators typically take one or two FWindows as input and produce a single FWindow as output.\",\"1110\":\"Operators can slide the FWindows to read different parts of the stream at runtime by updating its sync time.\",\"1111\":\"The only restriction is that FWindows can only move forward in time to ensure monotonic progress

LifeStream stores and accesses data at the granularity of FWindows and they contain events of continuous fixed size interval, having small gaps in the input data might cause memory fragmentation.\",\"1198\":\"This might lead to low memory utilization, and in turn, low query execution performance.\",\"1199\":\"However, as shown in Figure 2, most of the raw physiological data\\u2019s discontinuities are generally concentrated on specific time periods rather than being randomly scattered throughout the stream.\",\"1200\":\"Hence most parts of the stream has continuous and densely packed sequence of data which ensures high memory utilization.\",\"1201\":\"However, when small gaps occur, we handle them by setting the bitvector field in the corresponding position in the FWindow to mark the absence of the events.\",\"1202\":\"Another possible cause of fragmentation is when Where query is used to filter out certain events in the stream, based on an arbitrary predicate defined by the programmer.\",\"1203\":\"From our experience building pipelines using LifeStream, Where operation is the least commonly used primitive operation.\",\"1204\":\"Even when used, it is mostly to filter out a large continuous portion of the stream (e.g., remove noisy regions or artifacts from the data).\",\"1205\":\"Therefore, the chances for FWindow fragmentation are minimum.\",\"1206\":\"In the use cases that we evaluate in this work (see Section 8), we observe the degree of the FWindow fragmentation is at most 0.3%, which is too small to impact query performance negatively.\",\"1207\":\"6.3 Stateful Temporal Operators Since the query execution in LifeStream is done at the FWindow granularity and the memory allocated for the FWindows is rewritten, certain operators may need to maintain an internal state throughout the query execution (e.g., rolling aggregate operations).\",\"1208\":\"To handle such cases, LifeStream allows operators to create constant

figure.\",\"1304\":\"First, LifeStream outperforms both Trill and NumLib by 7.5\\u00d7 and 3.2\\u00d7 respectively.\",\"1305\":\"This reinstates that, even though individual operators in the numerical libraries can exhibit high performance when executed in isolation (as we show in Section 3), it does not necessarily translate into the best end-to-end performance due to data conversion overhead and lack of end-to-end optimizations [40].\",\"1306\":\"Second, in the case of Trill, as the size of the dataset increases, the execution time rises rapidly, and Trill goes out of memory at 200\\ud835\\udc40 events.\",\"1307\":\"Our investigation reveals that this happens because of Trill\\u2019s implementation issue with the Join operation.\",\"1308\":\"Trill expects both left and right streams of the Join operation to progress at a similar pace.\",\"1309\":\"However, if the two streams diverge considerably, the Join operator\\u2019s internal memory keeps accumulating until the available memory is exhausted.\",\"1310\":\"Since physiological data contains a high degree of discontinuity, it is very common for such divergence to occur during query processing.\",\"1311\":\"LifeStream uses targeted query processing optimization (described in Section 5.3) to skip over such non-overlapping parts of the input data.\",\"1312\":\"8.4 Generality Using LifeStream, we were able to bring two data analytics models developed at the Sickkids hospital into practical deployment and real-world use, namely line-zero artifact detection model (LineZero) and cardiac arrest prediction model (CAP) [52].\",\"1313\":\"These models demand diverse data analytic requirements.\",\"1314\":\"For instance, line-zero artifact detection model performs a sliding window-based normalization operation.\",\"1315\":\"The cardiac arrest prediction model pipeline joins 6 different signal types together after performing operations like normalization, signal upsampling, signal value imputation, and event masking on each signal stream.\",\"1316\":\"Table 4: Throughput in million events per second Model Trill LifeStream Speedup LineZero 0.027 0.315

achieves 11.58\\u00d7 and 5.04\\u00d7 speedup over Trill on LineZero and CAP respectively.\",\"1318\":\"8.5 Sensitivity Studies In this section, we conduct experiments to analyze the effectiveness of the optimizations applied in LifeStream.\",\"1319\":\"Cache Utilization.\",\"1320\":\"To analyze how well LifeStream utilizes the cache compared to Trill using optimizations such as locality tracing, we conduct an experiment to measure the last level cache (LLC) misses of both engines on one of the most commonly used operation \\u2013 Normalize.\",\"1321\":\"In order to avoid the influence of data discontinuities in the measurements, we use synthetic dataset for this experiment.\",\"1322\":\"We use Intel vTune [24] to measure the cache misses during the query execution over a constant size

batch size of 105, LifeStream is experiencing 3\\u00d7 lower cache misses as that of Trill.\",\"1325\":\"As the batch size increases, the number of cache misses in Trill increases significantly while LifeStream\\u2019s miss rate stays relatively constant.\",\"1326\":\"As we describe in Section 5.2, Trill\\u2019s inability to preserve cross-operation locality is the primary reason for this behaviour.\",\"1327\":\"The consequence of this limitation becomes more pronounced on larger batch sizes.\",\"1328\":\"LifeStream, on the other hand, preserves the end-to-end locality of the query using locality tracing irrespective of the batch size.\",\"1329\":\"Targeted Query Processing.\",\"1330\":\"This section analyzes the effectiveness of targeted query processing while running large data processing pipelines.\",\"1331\":\"We pick the ECG and ABP signals of several different dates from the real dataset with varying degrees of overlapping events between them to perform this analysis.\",\"1332\":\"Figure 10(a) shows the relative performance speedup of LifeStream over Trill, measured with respect to the percentage of overlapping events in these data subsets.\",\"1333\":\"We observe that, as expected, the speedup is smaller when there is near perfect overlap, which is about 7\\u00d7.\",\"1334\":\"The speedup starts to increase as the degree of overlap decreases, because LifeStream can skip more and more redundant computations compared to Trill.\",\"1335\":\"For example, a day with 10% overlap in ECG and ABP leads to about 38\\u00d7 speedup over Trill, which is about 5\\u00d7 higher than the base performance of LifeStream.\",\"1336\":\"Window size In this section, we conduct a sensitivity study on LifeStream to measure the effect of window size on its performance.\",\"1337\":\"Figure 10(b) shows the execution time of Trill and LifeStream on the end-to-end benchmark over the synthetic dataset with window size varying from 1 minute to 1 hour.\",\"1338\":\"The results suggest that LifeStream can maintain its performance benefits compared to Trill even on larger windows.\",\"1339\":\"8.6 Scalability Physiological datasets generally contain signals collected from thousands of patients, and the data processing pipelines usually process data from different patients separately.\",\"1340\":\"That means the data processing can be parallelized across multiple patients.\",\"1341\":\"LifeStream takes advantage of this data-parallel nature of the physiological dataset to scale up the computation to both (i) multiple cores within a machine and (ii) multiple machines.\",\"1342\":\"We evaluate the scalability of LifeStream and compare it against Trill and numerical libraries on a single AWS m5a.8xlarge [4] machine with 32 cores and 128 GB DRAM on the end-to-end benchmark using synthetic dataset.\",\"1343\":\"Figure 10(c) shows total number of signal events processed per second against the number of parallel threads of data pipeline execution.\",\"1344\":\"We observe that LifeStream provides up to 6.02\\u00d7 better scalability than Trill and 1.90\\u00d7 better than numerical libraries.\",\"1345\":\"This shows that LifeStream can maintain its performance benefits on multi-core parallel data pipeline execution compared to Trill and provide better parallel processing capabilities than numerical library-based approach.\",\"1346\":\"We also observe that Trill goes out of memory and crashes when we run experiments with more than 12 parallel threads.\",\"1347\":\"LifeStream, on the other hand, is much more memory-efficient and can scale up to 32 parallel threads as the memory required for the intermediate results are preallocated are reused throughout query execution.\",\"1348\":\"Numerical library-based implementation is observed to scale up to 48 threads; however, the performance gets saturated after 24 threads and exhibits a peak performance that is 44% lower than that of LifeStream.\",\"1349\":\"We also measure the scalability of LifeStream on a multi-machine setup using up to 16 Amazon EC2 m5a.8xlarge [4] machines with each running 12, 24 and 32 parallel threads respectively for Trill, numerical libraries, and LifeStream, since these thread counts are observed to provide the peak performance from multi-core experiment.\",\"1350\":\"Figure 10(d) shows the throughput measured against the number of machines.\",\"1351\":\"On 16 machines, LifeStream can process 473.66 million events per second which is 8.38\\u00d7 higher than the peak performance of Trill and 1.73\\u00d7 higher than that of numerical libraries.\",\"1352\":\"This shows that LifeStream can maintain the performance benefits at large scale through efficient data-parallel processing.\",\"1353\":\"9 RELATED WORK Several major solutions were proposed in the past to address large scale stream processing demands [3, 34, 54, 59].\",\"1354\":\"Unfortunately, these solutions fail to be a good fit for physiological data processing due to the unique requirements of (i) programmability or (ii) performance (or sometimes even both).\",\"1355\":\"Below, we provide a detailed comparison of LifeStream against key prior works based on these two aspects.\",\"1356\":\"Stream Processing Engines Popular stream processing engines such as Apache Spark stream [5], Storm [54], Flink [10], and Beam [3] provide simple declarative programming interfaces for writing complex data processing pipelines.\",\"1357\":\"However, most of them fail to support several features essential for physiological data processing.\",\"1358\":\"For instance, Storm [54] does not have any implicit notion of event time or windowing.\",\"1359\":\"Spark streaming, on the other hand, does not have support for millisecond precision event time as required for many signals in physiological data and lacks several useful temporal primitive operations that are necessary for writing queries on physiological data.\",\"1360\":\"Additionally, as we show in Section 3, these solutions are primarily designed for distributed setup and showcase poor single machine performance.\",\"1361\":\"Trill [11] is the closest streaming engine we could find that provides rich support for temporal operations, high precision event time, and flexible windowing, as well as 1 \\u2212 2 orders of magnitude higher single machine performance than distributed streaming engines.\",\"1362\":\"Unlike Trill, LifeStream takes advantage of the end-to-end locality of the entire data pipeline using locality tracing.\",\"1363\":\"Additionally, LifeStream employs optimizations like static memory allocation and targeted query processing to minimize runtime memory \\fASPLOS \\u201921, April 19\\u201323,

significantly faster than strong baselines like Trill.\",\"1365\":\"A follow-up work called TrillDSP [35] extends Trill query language interface to support digital signal processing (DSP) operations like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\",\"1366\":\"Both LifeStream and TrillDSP have similar motivations and they both deal with periodic data streams.\",\"1367\":\"However, TrillDSP is primarily focused on providing a programming interface that is suitable for people who are familiar with common signal processing libraries in R and MATLAB, simultaneously supporting stream processing capabilities of Trill without having to make expensive communications with these external libraries.\",\"1368\":\"LifeStream proposes a more general solution which addresses both programmability and performance aspects of periodic stream processing.\",\"1369\":\"Moreover, the proposed query optimizations in our work, namely locality tracing, static memory allocation, and targeted query processing are unique contributions of LifeStream.\",\"1370\":\"Following the footsteps of Trill, there are two other streaming engines recently proposed, StreamBox [29] and StreamBox-HBM [28] that focus on improving the single machine performance.\",\"1371\":\"However, both these designs provide a very low-level and generic programming abstraction and lack a rich high-level temporal language support.\",\"1372\":\"Additionally, StreamBox-HBM was designed specifically for machines with high bandwidth memory (HBM), which are both very rare4 and expensive.\",\"1373\":\"Compared to these two engines, 4In fact, Intel\\u2019s Knight Landing architecture used in StreamBox-HBM is discontinued now [21].\",\"1374\":\"LifeStream provides a much simpler programming interface with high performance on commodity hardware.\",\"1375\":\"Numerical Libraries There have been some recent studies [39, 41] to improve the performance of numerical library-based data processing pipelines.\",\"1376\":\"Weld [39] proposed a compiler-based approach to optimize across disjoint libraries and functions with the help of an intermediate representation (IR).\",\"1377\":\"The followup work, called Split Annotations [41], eliminates the need for an IR and re-implementation of library functions while potentially providing similar end-to-end performance benefits.\",\"1378\":\"Even though these solutions can improve the end-to-end performance of numerical library-based data processing pipelines by some margin, the lack of temporal logic support and unified API specification still make such approaches less desirable in terms of ease of programming and maintainability.\",\"1379\":\"We believe high-level temporal query language provided by LifeStream is more systematic and appropriate approach for doing data processing on physiological data.\",\"1380\":\"Time-series Databases There are several databases specially designed to store and process time-series datasets efficiently.\",\"1381\":\"However, we find time-series databases like InfluxDB [23] and KDB [50] to be a poor fit for physiological data processing.\",\"1382\":\"For instance, InfluxDB does not follow relational data model.\",\"1383\":\"Therefore, it does not have flexible temporal Join support, a common operation in the physiological data processing.\",\"1384\":\"Moreover, these databases only provide limited windowing support.\",\"1385\":\"KDB, on the other hand, requires the \\fLifeStream: A High-Performance Stream Processing Engine for Periodic Streams ASPLOS \\u201921, April

Indeed, more than 80% of the Fortune 100 companies currently use some stream processing platform, e.g., Apache Flink, Kafka Streams. Unlike traditional batch processing where data is collected over time and then analyzed, stream processing applications continuously query and analyze data, which enables faster response. Despite the great success of the stream processing paradigm, \ntesting a networked stream processing application (particularly at scale) is still a cumbersome and often expensive process. On one hand, developers and operators must cope with all challenges associated to deploying a networked system (e.g., routing, addressing, monitoring). On the other hand, they also need to rely on either costly testbeds (usually a cluster of servers organized into some pre-defined, i.e., fixed topology) or complex cloud-based setups for running their experiments. Ultimately, these challenges delay new advancements in the area and sometimes even forbid interested parties to participate on it.\nThis work presents Raptor, a tool designed to lower the cost (i.e., time and money) of prototyping and experimenting with large-scale networked stream processing applications. Raptor combines the flexibility and realism of a network emulator (Mininet) with the generality of a widespread event streaming platform (Apache Kafka) to provide developers an easy way to test their solutions under multiple operational conditions (e.g., different network loads and topologies, replication mechanisms, failure models). The tool can run reasonably large setups (beyond 20 nodes) on a commodity server and offers a great set of detailed measurements, including bandwidth and latency reports as well as event logs. We hope Raptor can also facilitate the reproducibility of research results in the stream processing domain.
